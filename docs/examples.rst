The `alignparse <https://jbloomlab.github.io/alignparse/>`_ package is designed to aid in the analysis of long-read sequencing of user-defined amplicons. Major functionaly includes:
    - The :class:`alignparse.targets.Targets` class for defining reference sequence `Targets`, aligning reads, and parsing features from aligned reads.
    - The :mod:`alignparse.consensus` for analyzing mutations and sequencing accuracy, especially for sequences grouped by shared barcodes.

Here are some examples that demonstrate how to utilize this functionality and other aspects of the `alignparse <https://jbloomlab.github.io/alignparse/>`_ package:
